# Raw Load Tester
This open source configurable javascript/PHP application calls the URL you select as many times as you choose and tells you how long it took the server to respond. It writes some additional runtime details to the PHP log file so you can optionally do more granular analysis afterwards. 

## Metrics
Although the server processes most of the statistics, all URL requests come from the browser. You can run as many browsers and workstations simultaneously as you want.
